Image and Digit Classifier GUI
This project provides a graphical user interface (GUI) to train and classify images of cats, dogs, and digits using two separate modules. The goal is to simplify the interaction with machine learning models for different classification tasks.

Features
Cat and Dog Classifier (trcd.py): Train and classify images of cats and dogs.
Digit Recognizer (train.py): Train and classify handwritten digits.
User-Friendly GUI: A single interface to interact with both modules seamlessly
